<p>SUMMARY &amp; USAGE LICENSE</p>

<h6 id="label-"></h6>

<p>MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the
University of Minnesota.</p>

<p>This data set consists of:</p>

<pre>* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
* Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)</pre>

<p>The data was collected through the MovieLens web site (movielens.umn.edu)
during the seven-month period from September 19th,  1997 through April
22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users who had less than 20
ratings or did not have complete demographic information were removed from
this data set. Detailed descriptions of the data file can be found at the
end of this file.</p>

<p>Neither the University of Minnesota nor any of the researchers involved can
guarantee the correctness of the data, its suitability for any particular
purpose, or the validity of results based on the use of the data set.  The
data set may be used for any research purposes under the following
conditions:</p>

<pre>* The user may not state or imply any endorsement from the
  University of Minnesota or the GroupLens Research Group.

* The user must acknowledge the use of the data set in
  publications resulting from the use of the data set, and must
  send us an electronic or paper copy of those publications.

* The user may not redistribute the data without separate
  permission.

* The user may not use this information for any commercial or
  revenue-bearing purposes without first obtaining permission
  from a faculty member of the GroupLens Research Project at the
  University of Minnesota.</pre>

<p>FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUPLENS RESEARCH PROJECT</p>

<h6 id="label-"></h6>

<p>The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of
Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Members of
the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects
related to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering,
and recommender systems. The project is lead by professors John Riedl and
Joseph Konstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative
filtering in 1992, but is most well known for its world wide trial of an
automated collaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996.  The
technology developed in the Usenet trial formed the base for the formation
of Net Perceptions, Inc., which was founded by members of GroupLens
Research. Since then the project has expanded its scope to research overall
information filtering solutions, integrating in content-based methods as
well as improving current collaborative filtering technology.</p>

publications, can be found at the following web site:</p>

<p>GroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on
collaborative filtering:</p>

<p>DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF DATA FILES</p>

<h6 id="label-"></h6>

<p>Here are brief descriptions of the data.</p>

<p>ml-data.tar.gz   -- Compressed tar file.  To rebuild the u data files do
this:</p>

<pre>gunzip ml-data.tar.gz
tar xvf ml-data.tar
mku.sh</pre>

<p>u.data     -- The full u data set, 100000 ratings by 943 users on 1682
items.</p>

<pre>Each user has rated at least 20 movies.  Users and items are
numbered consecutively from 1.  The data is randomly
ordered. This is a tab separated list of 
   user id | item id | rating | timestamp. 
The time stamps are unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC</pre>

<p>u.info     -- The number of users, items, and ratings in the u data set.</p>

<p>u.item     -- Information about the items (movies); this is a tab separated</p>

<pre>list of
movie id | movie title | release date | video release date |
IMDb URL | unknown | Action | Adventure | Animation |
Children's | Comedy | Crime | Documentary | Drama | Fantasy |
Film-Noir | Horror | Musical | Mystery | Romance | Sci-Fi |
Thriller | War | Western |
The last 19 fields are the genres, a 1 indicates the movie
is of that genre, a 0 indicates it is not; movies can be in
several genres at once.
The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.</pre>

<p>u.genre    -- A list of the genres.</p>

<p>u.user     -- Demographic information about the users; this is a tab</p>

<pre>separated list of
user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code
The user ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.</pre>

<p>u.occupation -- A list of the occupations.</p>

<p>u1.base    -- The data sets u1.base and u1.test through u5.base and u5.test
u1.test       are 80%/20% splits of the u data into training and test data.
u2.base       Each of u1, ..., u5 have disjoint test sets; this if for
u2.test       5 fold cross validation (where you repeat your experiment
u3.base       with each training and test set and average the results).
u3.test       These data sets can be generated from u.data by mku.sh.
u4.base u4.test u5.base u5.test</p>

<p>ua.base    -- The data sets ua.base, ua.test, ub.base, and ub.test ua.test 
split the u data into a training set and a test set with ub.base      
exactly 10 ratings per user in the test set.  The sets ub.test      
ua.test and ub.test are disjoint.  These data sets can</p>

<pre>be generated from u.data by mku.sh.</pre>

<p>allbut.pl  -- The script that generates training and test sets where</p>

<pre>all but n of a users ratings are in the training data.</pre>

<p>mku.sh     -- A shell script to generate all the u data sets from u.data.</p>
